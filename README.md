# LangGraph Supervisor Demo

This project implements a **LangGraph Supervisor Agent**. The supervisor coordinates specialized worker agents that handle subtasks like research, summarization, scraping, and code generation.

---

##  How the Agent Works
- **Input**: The user provides an objective (e.g., *"Research phishing URL detection papers 2024, summarize, and generate Python script"*).  
- **Supervisor Agent**: Interprets the objective and delegates subtasks.  
- **Worker Agents**: Execute tasks such as:
  - Research & summarization
  - Web scraping
  - Python script generation
  - File writing
- **Output**: Results are written to a file or printed depending on requirements.

---

## Architecture Overview
- **Supervisor Agent**  
  Coordinates workflow and decides which worker agent to call.

- **Worker Agents**  
  - *Research Agent*: Searches and summarizes papers.  
  - *Scraper Agent*: Extracts data from websites.  
  - *Coder Agent*: Generates Python code when required.  
  - *Writer Agent*: Saves results to `.txt` files.
