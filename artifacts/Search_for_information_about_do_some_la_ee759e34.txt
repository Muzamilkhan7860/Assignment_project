    "snippet": "**_Machine Learning:_** Nowadays, Machine Learning is a prevalent approach for detecting phishing websites (Sindhu et al., 2020). After that, Machine Learning classifiers are trained to detect the phishing website based on those features (Zhu et al., 2020). The limitations of this work are: the review is based on 67 research items, and the study does not include Deep Learning techniques for phishing website detection. (Benavides et al., 2020) conducted a systematic review to analyze different approaches of other researchers for detecting phishing attacks by applying Deep Learning algorithms. Wu et al., 2019C.Y.

    "snippet": "Since late 2024, Unit 42 researchers have observed attackers using several new tactics in phishing documents containing QR codes. Another tactic involves attackers adopting Cloudflare Turnstile for user verification, enabling them to evade security crawlers and convincingly redirect targets to a login page. Analysis of the URLs extracted from the QR codes in these campaigns reveals that attackers typically avoid including URLs that directly point to the phishing domain. By using URL redirection, attackers can surreptitiously redirect users to malicious websites while masking the true destination of the phishing link. Attackers\u2019 increasing use of QR codes in phishing highlights the need for improved security awareness training and technical solutions that can detect and block these threats."
