Let Wiz help: https://ntck.co/wiz\n\nCan you hack AI? In this video I sit down with elite AI hacker Jason Haddix to unpack how attackers compromise AI-enabled apps\u2014not just jailbreak chatbots, but exfiltrate customer data, abuse tool calls, and pivot across systems. We walk through his six-part AI pentest blueprint, play the Gandalf prompt-injection game, and demo wild techniques like emoji smuggling and link smuggling. You\u2019ll see real-world cases (think Slack salesbots + Salesforce leaks), why MCP (Model Context Protocol) and agentic frameworks can widen the blast radius, and then we flip to defense: web-layer fundamentals, a \u201cfirewall for AI\u201d on inputs/outputs, and least-privilege for data and tools\u2014plus a hands-on demo you can try. If you\u2019re building with AI in 2025, this is your wake-up call (and your roadmap).

AI improves general threat monitoring by helping security teams detect, prioritize, and respond to risks more effectively. Once your AI threat detection model is selected, train it on your prepared data to distinguish between normal and suspicious behavior. **A tip from N-iX experts:** Generative AI can be used here to create sample malware or attack patterns, helping you evaluate how well the model detects unfamiliar threats. We\u2019ve explored how AI transforms threat detection capabilities across networks, endpoints, identity systems, and monitoring solutions throughout this guide. Why should you implement AI threat detection with N-iX?"
