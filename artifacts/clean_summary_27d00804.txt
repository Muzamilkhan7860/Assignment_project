Hereâ€™s a clear summary of the findings:

1. **AI and Machine Learning for Malware Detection**:  
   - AI and machine learning (ML) are increasingly used to detect and classify malware, including ransomware, trojans, worms, and botnets.  
   - Models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are adapted for malware classification by analyzing semantic features of malware files.  

2. **Key Datasets and Challenges**:  
   - Studies leverage datasets like the **Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge** and **VirusShare.com** for training models.  
   - Challenges include improving semantic segmentation of malware files to enhance classification accuracy.  

3. **Deep Learning Advances**:  
   - Deep learning (DL) shows promise, particularly in detecting **ransomware** and new malware variants.  
   - Techniques like **natural language processing (NLP)** are applied to malware classification for better pattern recognition.  

4. **Trends and Gaps**:  
   - Research highlights the need for **automated, scalable detection systems**, especially for IoT and enterprise environments.  
   - Some ML approaches lack semantic analysis, which could improve performance.  

5. **Systematic Reviews**:  
   - Surveys summarize DL and ML methods, emphasizing their effectiveness but also noting challenges like evolving malware evasion tactics.  

**Overall**, AI/ML-based malware detection is advancing, with deep learning and semantic analysis playing key roles, but gaps remain in handling new threats and improving interpretability.
